# Coding-Quiz

## Description

This web application is a short and fun little quiz to keep your mind fresh on javascript, html and css. 
My motivation behind this project was to enhance my knowlegde on the languages I have learned via the quiz and for practice in future job roles. 
I build this project so that I can become familiar with coding assessments and so I can apply what I have learned about dynamic JavaScript.
